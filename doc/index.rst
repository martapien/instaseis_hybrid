Instaseis calculates broadband seismograms from Green's function databases
generated with `AxiSEM <http://axisem.info>`_  and allows for near
instantaneous (on the order of milliseconds) extraction of seismograms. Using
the 2.5D axisymmetric spectral element method, the generation of these
databases, based on reciprocity of the Green’s functions, is very efficient and
is approximately half as expensive as a single AxiSEM forward run. Thus this
enables the computation of full databases at half the cost of the computation of
seismograms for a single source in the previous scheme and hence allows to
compute databases at the highest frequencies globally observed. By storing the
basis coefficients of the numerical scheme (Lagrange polynomials), the Green’s
functions are 4th order accurate in space and the spatial discretization
respects discontinuities in the velocity model exactly. On top, AxiSEM allows to
include 2D structure in the source receiver plane and readily includes other
planets such as Mars.

Syngine - Instaseis databases hosted by the IRIS DMC
----------------------------------------------------

Please note that the IRIS DMC hosts a large collection of Instaseis databases
that also supports the dynamic extraction of seismograms. Thus no database must
actually reside on your PC - Syngine will extract them for you and send the
resulting seismograms over HTTP. Additionally Syngine can be used as a database
backend from within Instaseis.

Installation
------------

.. admonition:: Installation using conda-forge

    By far the easiest way to install Instaseis is to `download
    Anaconda/Miniconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_, install it and
    then run

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ conda install -c conda-forge instaseis

    This will download and install Instaseis including all its dependencies.
    For other options, please keep on reading.


Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instaseis is implemented as a Python library and has a number of dependencies
listed here. It might well work with other versions but only the versions listed
here are continuously tested and supported. Instaseis currently runs on Linux
and Mac OS X. Adding support for Windows is mainly a question of compiling the
shared Fortran librarys - pull requests are welcome.

* ``gfortran >= 4.7``
* ``Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5``
* ``NumPy >= 1.7``
* ``ObsPy >= 1.0.2``
* ``h5py``
* ``future``
* ``requests``
* ``tornado``
* ``jsonschema >= 2.4``
* ``geographiclib``

To run the tests, please also install:

* ``flake8``
* ``pytest``
* ``pytest-xdist``
* ``responses``
* ``mock`` *(only for Python 2.x, otherwise part of the standard library)*

The optional graphical user interface furthermore requires

* ``PyQt4``
* ``pyqtgraph``
* ``matplotlib``
* ``basemap``

Fortran Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have ``gfortran``, please install it (on Linux) with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install gfortran

or the equivalent of your distribution. On OSX we recommend to install
`Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ and then use it to install ``gfortran``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install gcc

Python and Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you know what you are doing, just make sure the aforementioned
dependencies are installed. Otherwise do yourself a favor and download the
`Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ Python distribution.
It is a free scientific Python distribution bundling almost all necessary
modules with a convenient installer (does not require root access!).
Once installed assert that ``pip`` and ``conda`` point to the Anaconda
installation folder (you may need to open a new terminal after installing
Anaconda).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge obspy h5py future requests tornado flake8 pytest mock basemap pyqt pip jsonschema responses pyqtgraph pytest-xdist

A possible complication arises **if you are running on a server without a
display**. In that case please edit (on Linux)
``~/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc`` (create if it does not exist) and make
sure the following line is part of it:

.. code-block:: bash

    backend: agg


A fairly recent development is that ``conda``, on some systems, ships
``libgfortran3`` versions incompatible with the system libraries. If you see
errors like::

    ImportError:
    /home/travis/miniconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/scipy/special/../../../../libgfortran.so.3:
    version `GFORTRAN_1.4' not found

please try the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda remove libgfortran --force

and if that results in some other issues (try it first!), also execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install libgcc --force


Installing Instaseis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the prerequisites are fulfilled, installation of the latest stable
Instaseis version is as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install instaseis

Developer Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the git repository and install in an editable fashion.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/krischer/instaseis.git
    $ cd instaseis
    $ pip install -v -e .


Testing
^^^^^^^

Many test run without these two packages, but executing the full test suite
requires two additional packages: ``click`` and ``netcdf4``. If you don't
already have them, install with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install click netcdf4


To assert that your installation is working properly, execute

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m instaseis.tests

and make sure all tests pass. Otherwise please contact the developers. To
speed up the tests they can also be run in parallel with (``n`` is the
number of cores):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /path/to/instaseis
    $ py.test -n 4


Build the Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The documentation requires ``sphinx`` and the Bootstrap theme. Install both
with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install sphinx sphinx-bootstrap-theme

Build the doc with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd doc
    $ make html

Finally open the ``doc/_build/html/index.html`` file with the browser of your
choice.


Tutorial
--------

Learning Python and ObsPy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instaseis is written in `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ and utilizes the
data structures of `ObsPy <http://obspy.org>`_ to allow the construction of
modern and efficient workflows. Python is an easy to learn and powerful
interactive programming language with an exhaustive scientific ecosystem. The
following resources are useful if you are starting out with Python and ObsPy:

* `Good, general Python tutorial <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_
* `IPython Notebook in Nature <http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261>`_
* `Introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem <https://scipy-lectures.github.io/>`_
* `The ObsPy Documentation <http://docs.obspy.org/master>`_
* `The ObsPy Tutorial <http://docs.obspy.org/master/tutorial/index.html>`_


Acquiring A Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use Instaseis, one requires access to a waveform database.
`AxiSEM <http://axisem.info>`_ has to be used to calculate one from scratch. In
the near future we plan to offer remote databases that Instaseis can then
connect to. As these database tend to get very big we so far cannot offer them
as a download. If you are interested in a big database, please contact us.

To quickly get started, please download one of these low frequency
example databases (please note that they may only be available temporarily):

* `PREM 20 seconds dominant period <http://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/~krischer/instaseis/20s_PREM_ANI_FORCES.tar.gz>`_ (581 MB)
* `PREM 10 seconds dominant period <http://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/~krischer/instaseis/10s_PREM_ANI_FORCES.tar>`_ (3.4 GB)

Using Instaseis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use Instaseis you first have to open a connection to an Instaseis database.
Instaseis supports connections to local and remote Green's function databases; a
local database consists of up to four NetCDF files on the filesystem whereas a
remote database requires an Instaseis server answering queries. The usage and
capabilities of both are completely equivalent. This section deals with using
Instaseis to generate seismograms; if you wish to run an Instaseis server,
please see the documentation of the :doc:`server`.

Connecting to either a local or a remote Instaseis database happens with the
:func:`~instaseis.open_db` function. It will return either an
:class:`~instaseis.instaseis_db.InstaseisDB` or a
:class:`~instaseis.remote_instaseis_db.RemoteInstaseisDB` object. Additional
arguments and keyword arguments are passed to the the initialization
function of these objects. Once the database objects are created, usage of
both is identical. Be aware that the initialization of the database objects
is potentially a fairly expensive operation so make sure to do it more often
than necessary (usually once per database).


.. note::

    If opening a local database and the ``ordered_output.nc4`` files are
    located for example in ``/path/to/DB/PZ/Data`` and ``/path/to/DB/PX/Data``,
    please pass ``/path/to/DB`` to the :func:`~instaseis.open_db` function.
    Instaseis will recursively search the child directories for the necessary
    files and open them.


.. code-block:: python

    >>> import instaseis

    >>> # Open connection to a local database by giving the path on disc where
    >>> # the `ordered_output.nc4` files of AxiSEM are stored.
    >>> db = instaseis.open_db("/path/to/10s_PREM")

    >>> # Or open connection to a remote database by giving an HTTP URL.
    >>> db = instaseis.open_db("http://123.456.789.123:1234")

    >>> # Get some basic information by printing the database object.

The :meth:`~instaseis.base_instaseis_db.BaseInstaseisDB.get_seismograms()`
method is called to generate seismograms as :class:`~obspy.core.stream.Stream`
objects with the waveform data. This enables easy serialization in a large
selection of formats and facilitates post processing by utilizing ObsPy.

To generate seismograms source information must be given either as a
:class:`~instaseis.source.Source` object, a
:class:`~instaseis.source.ForceSource` object, or as a
:class:`~instaseis.source.FiniteSource` object. Receiver information must be
passed in form of a :class:`~instaseis.source.Receiver` object. Please refer
to the documentation of these classes for more details.

GUI
---

Instaseis contains an optional graphical user interface which is useful to
explore a database and for educational purposes. To launch it just type

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m instaseis.gui

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/FfEtlCU.png

Screenshot of the Instaseis graphical user interface (GUI). Aside from quickly
exploring the characteristics of a given Green’s function database it is a
great tool for understanding and teaching many aspect of seismograms. The speed
of Instaseis enables an immediate visual response to changing source and
receiver parameters. The left hand side shows three component seismograms where
theoretical arrival times of various seismic phases are overlaid as vertical
lines. The bar at the top is used to change filter and resampling settings and
the section on the right side is used to modify source and receiver parameters.
